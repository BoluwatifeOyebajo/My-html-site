    <P><strong>Biography</strong>: I'm a 20-year-old male Computer Science student at Kwara State
University. I come from a middle-class background and am the fifth of nine children. Growing up in a
large family has shaped my character in more ways than one - it has taught me patience, resilience,
and the value of working not just hard, but smart. These traits have been essential in my journey so
far, and they continue to drive me as I pursue a future in web design and development.</P>
    <P><strong>Why join the Program</strong>:The scholarship comes at a critical time for me. As part of my academic program, I will be
embarking on my Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) soon, which allows me to take
a break from lectures and focus on gaining hands-on experience. This is the perfect window for me
to fully dedicate myself to this frontend engineering program-without academic pressure, but with the
drive and time to commit fully. </P>
    <P><strong>Why frontend</strong>: My passion for Frontend Engineering stems from a deep interest in creating interactive, user-friendly digital experiences that blend creativity with technology. Iâ€™m fascinated by how code can transform ideas into visual reality, and I enjoy the immediate feedback that comes with building interfaces users engage with directly.
</P>
    <P><strong> Goal</strong>: To become a frontend engineer.I aim to write clean, responsive, and accessible code that not only works efficiently but also delivers a seamless experience across devices. The dynamic nature of frontend development, from solving layout challenges to enhancing user interactions. My goals go beyond just personal growth. I want to contribute meaningfully to the social and digital development of my community.</P>
